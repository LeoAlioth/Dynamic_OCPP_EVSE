# Open Issues

1. **Icon not shown in HA/HACS** — HA does not load `icon.png` from the custom component directory. The icon must be submitted as a PR to the [Home Assistant brands repo](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands). The `icon.png` file exists at `custom_components/dynamic_ocpp_evse/icon.png` and is ready to submit.

All other issues have been moved to detailed TODOs in `TODO.md`.
